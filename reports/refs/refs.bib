	abstract = {We evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the sample-based mean-variance model, and its extensions designed to reduce estimation error, relative to the naive 1/N portfolio. Of the 14 models we evaluate across seven empirical datasets, none is consistently better than the 1/N rule in terms of Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return, or turnover, which indicates that, out of sample, the gain from optimal diversification is more than offset by estimation error. Based on parameters calibrated to the US equity market, our analytical results and simulations show that the estimation window needed for the sample-based mean-variance strategy and its extensions to outperform the 1/N benchmark is around 3000 months for a portfolio with 25 assets and about 6000 months for a portfolio with 50 assets. This suggests that there are still many “miles to go” before the gains promised by optimal portfolio choice can actually be realized out of sample.},

The evidence indicates that momentum profits have continued in the 1990s, suggesting that the original results were not a product of data snooping bias. The paper also examines the predictions of recent behavioral models that propose that momentum profits are due to delayed overreactions that are eventually reversed. Our evidence provides support for the behavioral models, but this support should be tempered with caution.},

We find that the profitability of these strategies are not due to their systematic risk or to delayed stock price reactions to common factors. However, part of the abnormal returns generated in the first year after portfolio formation dissipates in the following two years. A similar pattern of returns around the earnings announcements of past winners and losers is also documented.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Minimum-variance portfolios and equally weighted portfolios have recently prompted great interest from both academic researchers and market practitioners because their construction does not rely on expected average returns and, therefore, is assumed to be robust. In this article, the authors consider a related approach in which the risk contribution from each portfolio component is made equal, maximizing the diversification of risk, at least, on an ex ante basis. Roughly speaking, the resulting portfolio is similar to a minimum-variance portfolio subject to a diversification constraint on the weights of its components. The authors derive the theoretical properties of such a portfolio and show that its volatility is located between those of minimum-variance and equally weighted portfolios. Empirical applications confirm that ranking. Equally weighted risk contribution portfolios appear to be an attractive alternative to minimum-variance and equally weighted portfolios and, therefore, could be considered a good trade-off between the two approaches in terms of absolute risk level, risk budgeting, and diversification.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}bold{\textgreater}TOPICS:{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} {\textless}ext-link{\textgreater}Portfolio construction{\textless}/ext-link{\textgreater}, {\textless}ext-link{\textgreater}analysis of individual factors/risk premia{\textless}/ext-link{\textgreater}, {\textless}ext-link{\textgreater}volatility measures{\textless}/ext-link{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
