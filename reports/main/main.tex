\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Background}:
  Selecting an optimal portfolio allocation across a universe of assets is a central problem in 
  investment management. While mean-variance optimisation, first proposed by Markowitz (1952), provides a 
  theoretically principled framework, its out-of-sample performance has proven disappointing in practice. 
  This study empirically compares four portfolio strategies to assess whether model sophistication translates 
  into superior investment performance. \\
\textbf{Methodology}:
  This study implements and compares four portfolio strategies: equal weight, Markowitz mean-variance, 
  Black-Litterman and Risk Parity applied to an 18-asset UK multi-asset portfolio comprising 15 FTSE 100 equities, 
  a UK government bond ETF, a gold ETC and a broad commodities ETF, over the period January 2015 to December 2025. 
  Strategies are evaluated using a monthly rebalancing framework and assessed across annualised return, volatility, 
  Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown and portfolio turnover. \\
\textbf{Results}: Highlight the main outcomes and observations. \\
\textbf{Conclusions}: Summarize the key insights and implications of your findings.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{The Portfolio Allocation Problem}
\indent \indent The portfolio allocation problem is the fundamental question in investment management. 
It asks: How should capital be distributed across available investment opportunities to best achieve 
an investor's objectives? \\
\indent The problem was intractable until 1952, when Harry Markowitz published \textit{Portfolio Selection} in the 
\textit{Journal of Finance} and turned it into a clean optimisation problem, and the “efficient frontier” 
gave investors a principled answer. Markowitz's mean variance model minimises portfolio variance for a given 
level of expected return. It was revolutionary in the consideration of variance as the risk, standing as a 
hallmark of modern portfolio theory. In practice however, the model has proven difficult to implement reliably. \\
\indent Michaud (1989) challenged this view directly, arguing that small estimation errors in expected 
returns produce wildly unstable portfolio recommendations. \\
\indent In 2009, DeMiguel et al. delivered a provocative result: he found that even sophisticated strategies 
incorporating shrinkage estimators and Bayesian methods failed to consistently outperform 1/N out-of-sample, 
suggesting that estimation error dominates theoretical optimality for typical portfolio problems. This tension 
between the theoretical elegance of optimisation and its empirical fragility motivates the present study. 


\subsection{Background and Research Objectives}
\indent \indent This study addresses three main questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do optimisation models outperform a naive 1/N benchmark
    out-of-sample, applied to a multi-asset UK portfolio over 
    a ten-year period? 
    \item Which model offers the best risk-adjusted performance, 
    as measured by the Sharpe ratio?
    \item How does model performance vary across distinct market
    regimes: the Brexit referendum (2016), the COVID-19 crash (2020),
    and the 2022 rate-hiking cycle?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Summary of Findings}
\subsection{Structure of the Report}
\indent \indent The remainder of this report is organised as follows: \newline
Section 2 reviews the theoretical foundations of each model 
and derives their key mathematical results. Section 3 
describes the data, implementation choices, and backtesting 
framework. Section 4 presents the empirical results, including 
full-period performance metrics and a breakdown by market 
regime. Section 5 discusses the findings and their practical 
implications. Section 6 concludes.

\section{Methodology}

This section details the design of your study, the data used, the models applied, and the analytical framework. 
The goal is to provide enough detail for another researcher to replicate your work.

\subsection{Data Acquisition and Processing}
Describe the data you used, where you got it from (e.g., Bloomberg, Refinitiv, web scraping), and any steps you 
took to clean, process, or transform it. Mention the time period and frequency of the data.

\subsection{Analytical Models}

\subsubsection{The equal-weight portfolio}

The equal-weight (1/N) portfolio assigns an identical weight of 1/N to each asset in the portfolio, regardless of any asset-specific characteristics such as return, volatility, or correlation. 
\citet{DeMiguel2009} tested 14 optimisation models across 7 datasets. None consistently outperformed the naive equal-weight portfolio: 
\[
  w_i^{\mathrm{EW}} = \frac{1}{n}.
\]
\paragraph{Why?} When expected returns are estimated from historical data in order to determine optimal portfolio weights, the estimates improve as more data is collected, but they do so slowly. Formally, the estimation error decays as.
\[
  \hat{\mu} - \mu = \mathcal{O}\!\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}\right).
\]
where $T$ is the number of observations. 

Because the error shrinks at rate $\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}$, halving the error requires four times as much data, meaning that with monthly data and realistic return distributions, approximately 500 years of observations are required for statistically reliable estimates. The equal-weight portfolio sidesteps this problem entirely: by assigning a fixed weight to each asset, it requires no parameter estimation and is therefore immune to estimation error by construction.

The cost of this simplicity, however, is that the portfolio ignores all information about assets' risk and return characteristics, makes no attempt to diversify risk efficiently, and cannot adapt to changing market conditions.

\subsubsection{Mean–Variance Optimisation}

\paragraph{Origins} \citet{Markowitz 1952} formulated portfolio selection as a constrained optimisation problem: minimise portfolio variance for a given level of expected return. Formally:
\[
 \min_{\mathbf{w}} \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{w}^\top \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}
\]
\text{subject to:} 
\[
\quad \mathbf{w}^\top \boldsymbol{\mu} = \mu^* \quad \text{(return constraint)}
\]
\[
\mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{1} = 1 \quad \text{(budget constraint)}
\]
\paragraph{What are two constraints?} The budget constraint ensures the weights represent a valid allocation of wealth. Without it, the optimiser will reduce variance by allocating weights toward zero. The return constraint pins the portfolio to a specific point on the risk-return spectrum. Together, these two constraints define the problem: there is a unique minimum-variance portfolio for each target return μ∗\mu^*
μ∗. 

Because the objective is quadratic and the constraints are linear equalities, we cannot solve the problem by direct substitution (two constraints, n unknowns). We therefore use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian formulation is:

\[
  \mathcal{L}(w, \lambda, \gamma)
    = \frac{1}{2}\,w^\top \Sigma w
      - \lambda\!\left(w^\top \mu - \mu_p\right)
      - \gamma\!\left(\mathbf{1}^\top w - 1\right).
\]
where $\lambda$ and $\gamma$ are the Lagrange multipliers associated with the return and budget constraints, respectively. Intuitively, $\lambda$ captures the marginal cost of requiring a higher return (i.e. how much additional variance must be accepted per unit increase in $\mu^*$), and $\gamma$ enforces full investment.

Taking the first-order condition:
\[
  \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w} = \Sigma w - \lambda \mu - \gamma \mathbf{1} = \mathbf{0}.
\]

Solving gives:
\[
  w^* = \lambda\,\Sigma^{-1}\mu + \gamma\,\Sigma^{-1}\mathbf{1}.
\]

Imposing the budget and return constraints leads to the following two-fund theorem: all efficient portfolios can be expressed as a linear combination of any two distinct efficient portfolios.
\[
  w_A = \frac{\Sigma^{-1}\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1}^\top \Sigma^{-1}\mathbf{1}},
  \qquad
  w_B = \frac{\Sigma^{-1}\mu}{\mathbf{1}^\top \Sigma^{-1}\mu}.
\]

The maximum \emph{Sharpe ratio} portfolio is:
\[
  w_{\mathrm{MSR}}
    = \frac{\Sigma^{-1}(\mu - r_f \mathbf{1})}
           {\mathbf{1}^\top \Sigma^{-1}(\mu - r_f \mathbf{1})}.
\]
\paragraph{The problem in practice.} Despite its theoretical elegance, Markowitz optimisation suffers from a well-documented problem. As mentioned above, the solution depends critically on $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, both estimated from historical data. Small errors in $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ can cause large shifts in optimal weights. \citet{Michaud 1989} characterised the optimiser as an ``error maximiser'': it systematically overweights assets with overestimated returns and underestimated variances.



\subsection{Backtesting or Validation Framework}
If you are testing a strategy, describe the backtesting framework. Mention key parameters like rebalancing 
frequency, transaction cost assumptions, and performance metrics used.
