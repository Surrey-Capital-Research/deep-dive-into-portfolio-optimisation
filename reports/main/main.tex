\section{Introduction}
Portfolio optimisation is a process of strategically selecting a diverse range of assets to build an 
investment portfolio that offers the maximum expected returns for a given level of risk. This can be 
calculated using mathematical models, of which we have selected four: Equally Weighted, Markowitz 
mean/variance optimisation, Black-Litterman and Risk Parity. Together, these models provide a strong 
theoretical foundation. While Mean-Variance optimisation is central to modern portfolio theory, it often
performs poorly in practice due to estimation errors. Therefore, an inclusion of Bayesian frameworks and
risk-based allocation methods is designed to improve robustness and empirical performance.

This report conducts a rigorous empirical comparison of portfolio optimisation, which is applied to a 
selected 18-asset portfolio spanning 2015-2025. The asset universe includes: UK equities, government 
bonds, precious metals and broader commodities. It defines the scope of our analysis so that findings 
are realistic and diversified in the investment universe. 

The objective of this project is to evaluate the risk-return performance by implementing and backtesting
multiple portfolio techniques to understand characteristics, trade-offs and practical applicability. 
While comparing classical optimisation techniques to alternative approaches to optimise empirical 
robustness in a real-world investment setting.

\subsection{Background and Research Objectives}
Provide the necessary background information for the reader to understand the context of your research. 
Clearly state your primary and secondary research objectives.

\section{Methodology}

This section details the design of your study, the data used, the models applied, and the analytical framework. 
The goal is to provide enough detail for another researcher to replicate your work.

\subsection{Data Acquisition and Processing}
Describe the data you used, where you got it from (e.g., Bloomberg, Refinitiv, web scraping), and any steps you 
took to clean, process, or transform it. Mention the time period and frequency of the data.

\subsection{Analytical Models}
\subsubsection{The equal-weight portfolio}

The equal-weight (1/N) portfolio assigns an identical weight of 1/N to each asset in the portfolio, regardless of any asset-specific characteristics such as return, volatility, or correlation. 
\citet{DeMiguel2009} tested 14 optimisation models across 7 datasets. None consistently outperformed the naive equal-weight portfolio: 
\[
  w_i^{\mathrm{EW}} = \frac{1}{n}.
\]
\paragraph{Why?} When expected returns are estimated from historical data in order to determine optimal portfolio weights, the estimates improve as more data is collected, but they do so slowly. Formally, the estimation error decays as.
\[
  \hat{\mu} - \mu = \mathcal{O}\!\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}\right).
\]
where $T$ is the number of observations. 

Because the error shrinks at rate $\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}$, halving the error requires four times as much data, meaning that with monthly data and realistic return distributions, approximately 500 years of observations are required for statistically reliable estimates. The equal-weight portfolio sidesteps this problem entirely: by assigning a fixed weight to each asset, it requires no parameter estimation and is therefore immune to estimation error by construction.

The cost of this simplicity, however, is that the portfolio ignores all information about assets' risk and return characteristics, makes no attempt to diversify risk efficiently, and cannot adapt to changing market conditions.

\subsubsection{Mean–Variance Optimisation}

\paragraph{Origins} \citet{Markowitz 1952} formulated portfolio selection as a constrained optimisation problem: minimise portfolio variance for a given level of expected return. Formally:
\[
 \min_{\mathbf{w}} \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{w}^\top \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}
\]
\text{subject to:} 
\[
\quad \mathbf{w}^\top \boldsymbol{\mu} = \mu^* \quad \text{(return constraint)}
\]
\[
\mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{1} = 1 \quad \text{(budget constraint)}
\]
\paragraph{What are two constraints?} The budget constraint ensures the weights represent a valid allocation of wealth. Without it, the optimiser will reduce variance by allocating weights toward zero. The return constraint pins the portfolio to a specific point on the risk-return spectrum. Together, these two constraints define the problem: there is a unique minimum-variance portfolio for each target return μ∗\mu^*
μ∗. 

Because the objective is quadratic and the constraints are linear equalities, we cannot solve the problem by direct substitution (two constraints, n unknowns). We therefore use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian formulation is:

\[
  \mathcal{L}(w, \lambda, \gamma)
    = \frac{1}{2}\,w^\top \Sigma w
      - \lambda\!\left(w^\top \mu - \mu_p\right)
      - \gamma\!\left(\mathbf{1}^\top w - 1\right).
\]
where $\lambda$ and $\gamma$ are the Lagrange multipliers associated with the return and budget constraints, respectively. Intuitively, $\lambda$ captures the marginal cost of requiring a higher return (i.e. how much additional variance must be accepted per unit increase in $\mu^*$), and $\gamma$ enforces full investment.

Taking the first-order condition:
\[
  \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w} = \Sigma w - \lambda \mu - \gamma \mathbf{1} = \mathbf{0}.
\]

Solving gives:
\[
  w^* = \lambda\,\Sigma^{-1}\mu + \gamma\,\Sigma^{-1}\mathbf{1}.
\]

Imposing the budget and return constraints leads to the following two-fund theorem: all efficient portfolios can be expressed as a linear combination of any two distinct efficient portfolios.
\[
  w_A = \frac{\Sigma^{-1}\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1}^\top \Sigma^{-1}\mathbf{1}},
  \qquad
  w_B = \frac{\Sigma^{-1}\mu}{\mathbf{1}^\top \Sigma^{-1}\mu}.
\]

The maximum \emph{Sharpe ratio} portfolio is:
\[
  w_{\mathrm{MSR}}
    = \frac{\Sigma^{-1}(\mu - r_f \mathbf{1})}
           {\mathbf{1}^\top \Sigma^{-1}(\mu - r_f \mathbf{1})}.
\]
\paragraph{The problem in practice.} Despite its theoretical elegance, Markowitz optimisation suffers from a well-documented problem. As mentioned above, the solution depends critically on $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, both estimated from historical data. Small errors in $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ can cause large shifts in optimal weights. \citet{Michaud 1989} characterised the optimiser as an ``error maximiser'': it systematically overweights assets with overestimated returns and underestimated variances.


Describe the quantitative or qualitative models used in your analysis. Include mathematical formulations if 
applicable. For example, if you are using a regression model, you would specify it here:
\begin{equation}
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon
\end{equation}
Explain the variables and the assumptions of the model.

\subsection{Backtesting or Validation Framework}
If you are testing a strategy, describe the backtesting framework. Mention key parameters like rebalancing 
frequency, transaction cost assumptions, and performance metrics used.
