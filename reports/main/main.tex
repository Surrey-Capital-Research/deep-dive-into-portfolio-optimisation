\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Background}:
  Selecting an optimal portfolio allocation across a universe of assets is a central problem in 
  investment management. While mean-variance optimisation, first proposed by Markowitz (1952), provides a 
  theoretically principled framework, its out-of-sample performance has proven disappointing in practice. 
  This study empirically compares four portfolio strategies to assess whether model sophistication translates 
  into superior investment performance. \\
\textbf{Methodology}:
  This study implements and compares four portfolio strategies: equal weight, Markowitz mean-variance, 
  Black-Litterman and Risk Parity applied to an 18-asset UK multi-asset portfolio comprising 15 FTSE 100 equities, 
  a UK government bond ETF, a gold ETC and a broad commodities ETF, over the period January 2015 to December 2025. 
  Strategies are evaluated using a monthly rebalancing framework and assessed across annualised return, volatility, 
  Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown and portfolio turnover. \\
\textbf{Results}: Highlight the main outcomes and observations. \\
\textbf{Conclusions}: Summarize the key insights and implications of your findings.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{The Portfolio Allocation Problem}
\indent \indent The portfolio allocation problem is the fundamental question in investment management. 
It asks: How should capital be distributed across available investment opportunities to best achieve 
an investor's objectives? \\
\indent The problem was intractable until 1952, when Harry Markowitz published \textit{Portfolio Selection} in the 
\textit{Journal of Finance} and turned it into a clean optimisation problem, and the “efficient frontier” 
gave investors a principled answer. Markowitz's mean variance model minimises portfolio variance for a given 
level of expected return. It was revolutionary in the consideration of variance as the risk, standing as a 
hallmark of modern portfolio theory. In practice however, the model has proven difficult to implement reliably. \\
\indent Michaud (1989) challenged this view directly, arguing that small estimation errors in expected 
returns produce wildly unstable portfolio recommendations. \\
\indent In 2009, DeMiguel et al. delivered a provocative result: he found that even sophisticated strategies 
incorporating shrinkage estimators and Bayesian methods failed to consistently outperform 1/N out-of-sample, 
suggesting that estimation error dominates theoretical optimality for typical portfolio problems. This tension 
between the theoretical elegance of optimisation and its empirical fragility motivates the present study. 


\subsection{Background and Research Objectives}
\indent \indent This study addresses three main questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do optimisation models outperform a naive 1/N benchmark
    out-of-sample, applied to a multi-asset UK portfolio over 
    a ten-year period? 
    \item Which model offers the best risk-adjusted performance, 
    as measured by the Sharpe ratio?
    \item How does model performance vary across distinct market
    regimes: the Brexit referendum (2016), the COVID-19 crash (2020),
    and the 2022 rate-hiking cycle?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Summary of Findings}
\subsection{Structure of the Report}
\indent \indent The remainder of this report is organised as follows: \newline
Section 2 reviews the theoretical foundations of each model 
and derives their key mathematical results. Section 3 
describes the data, implementation choices, and backtesting 
framework. Section 4 presents the empirical results, including 
full-period performance metrics and a breakdown by market 
regime. Section 5 discusses the findings and their practical 
implications. Section 6 concludes.

\section{Methodology}

This section details the design of your study, the data used, the models applied, and the analytical framework. 
The goal is to provide enough detail for another researcher to replicate your work.

\subsection{Data Acquisition and Processing}
Describe the data you used, where you got it from (e.g., Bloomberg, Refinitiv, web scraping), and any steps you 
took to clean, process, or transform it. Mention the time period and frequency of the data.

\subsection{Analytical Models}
Describe the quantitative or qualitative models used in your analysis. Include mathematical formulations if 
applicable. For example, if you are using a regression model, you would specify it here:
\begin{equation}
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon
\end{equation}
Explain the variables and the assumptions of the model.

\subsection{Backtesting or Validation Framework}
If you are testing a strategy, describe the backtesting framework. Mention key parameters like rebalancing 
frequency, transaction cost assumptions, and performance metrics used.

\section{Results and Discussion}
