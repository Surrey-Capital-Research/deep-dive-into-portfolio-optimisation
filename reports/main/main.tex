\section{Introduction}
Portfolio optimisation is a process of strategically selecting a diverse range of assets to build an 
investment portfolio that offers the maximum expected returns for a given level of risk. This can be 
calculated using mathematical models, of which we have selected four: Equally Weighted, Markowitz 
mean/variance optimisation, Black-Litterman and Risk Parity. Together, these models provide a strong 
theoretical foundation. While Mean-Variance optimisation is central to modern portfolio theory, it often
performs poorly in practice due to estimation errors. Therefore, an inclusion of Bayesian frameworks and
risk-based allocation methods is designed to improve robustness and empirical performance.

This report conducts a rigorous empirical comparison of portfolio optimisation, which is applied to a 
selected 18-asset portfolio spanning 2015-2025. The asset universe includes: UK equities, government 
bonds, precious metals and broader commodities. It defines the scope of our analysis so that findings 
are realistic and diversified in the investment universe. 

The objective of this project is to evaluate the risk-return performance by implementing and backtesting
multiple portfolio techniques to understand characteristics, trade-offs and practical applicability. 
While comparing classical optimisation techniques to alternative approaches to optimise empirical 
robustness in a real-world investment setting.

\subsection{Background and Research Objectives}
Provide the necessary background information for the reader to understand the context of your research. 
Clearly state your primary and secondary research objectives.

\section{Methodology}

This section details the design of your study, the data used, the models applied, and the analytical framework. 
The goal is to provide enough detail for another researcher to replicate your work.

\subsection{Data Acquisition and Processing}
Describe the data you used, where you got it from (e.g., Bloomberg, Refinitiv, web scraping), and any steps you 
took to clean, process, or transform it. Mention the time period and frequency of the data.

\subsection{Analytical Models}
Describe the quantitative or qualitative models used in your analysis. Include mathematical formulations if 
applicable. For example, if you are using a regression model, you would specify it here:
\begin{equation}
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon
\end{equation}
Explain the variables and the assumptions of the model.

\subsection{Backtesting or Validation Framework}
If you are testing a strategy, describe the backtesting framework. Mention key parameters like rebalancing 
frequency, transaction cost assumptions, and performance metrics used.

\section{Results and Discussion}

This section presents the key findings from your analyses and interprets their significance \cite{example2023}. Use figures and tables to present your results clearly.

\subsection{Primary Findings}
Present your main results. This could be in the form of tables summarizing statistical outputs, or charts showing trends and relationships.

\end{table}

\subsection{Interpretation of Findings}
Discuss what your results mean. How do they relate to your initial research question? Are they consistent with existing literature? What are the implications of your findings?

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Summarize the main conclusions of your research. Reiterate the key insights and their importance.

Future work could include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exploring alternative methodologies or datasets.
    \item Addressing limitations of the current study.
    \item Expanding the research to a different market or asset class.
\end{itemize}
